  *CD-ROM* (an abbreviation of "Compact Disc read-only memory") is a pre-pressed Compact disc that contains data accessible but not writable by a computer. While the Compact Disc format was originally designed for music storage and playback, the 1985 yellow book standard developed by Sony and Philips adapted the format to hold any form of binary data.
