Delphi written small WinAPI only (without vcl) util to open/close CD-Rom drive from the windows systray.
It registers _global_ keyboard shortcuts, so you are able to open your cdDrive from every place you want just pressing _magic keyboard shortcut_ combination.
Made in 2002 year or about, I don't recall.))
